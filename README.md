## Getting Started
If you are wondering how to get up and running as fast as possible, you came to the right place.  

#### Get Workers
The first thing you want to do, as you are going through the tutorial, is buy workers. With the starting 1500 shiny, you can buy 2 workers. 3 Total workers is enough to get started, but you will want at least 4 ASAP. Wait until the 20th of the month and you can afford a 4th one. Everyone receives 400 shiny every month on the 20th. 

#### Farm Resources
** Warning: ** When attacking, you WILL lose your beginner protection shield.  

There are 2 super easy ways you can farm resources. Either attack some level 28 or level 32 Dreadnauts, or complete some upgrade quests. If you do not have any low level Dreadnauts or Legionnaires around, consider [relocating](#relocating).
1. You will have a few Pokies in your housing from the tutorial. Originally, there would be another part of the tutorial that leads you to attack some wild monster tribes, but that is not implemented in BYM Refitted. Instead, you can use these Pokies to attack lower level Dreadnauts for easy resources. 3-4 Pokies can take out the whole silo that sits outside the base in a few minutes. Just attacking it should net you a few thousand of each resource, and killing it completely will give well over 100,000 of each resource except goo, so you may want to save the killing for later after upgrading a silo or two.
    - Here are the spots you can attack 
    - ![Dreadnaut free loot](./Dreadnaut-free-spots.png)
2. Quests are pretty easy also. Upgrade one of each resource gatherer to maybe level 3. You will also get resources from upgrading your silo.  


#### Expand Your Storage
Standard Method: Upgrade your Town Hall to Level 4 and upgrade silos. This allows your Silos to hold the 1 million resources required for a standard takeover.  
The Shortcut: If you find a target directly adjacent to your main yard, the cost is cut in half (500,000). In this case, you only need a Town Hall 3.


#### Takeover First Outpost
Once you have 1 million storage capacity, you are ready to takeover something. Level 25 Legionnaires are the easiest and cheapest to takeover. You can swarm them with Pokeys or Octo-oozes if you decided to unlock that already. Make sure to bring their yard status to at least 90% damaged to take it over. If you need resources, don't forget to attack Dreadnauts in the area for free. It may take a few tries to get enough goo this way, or you can attack a higher level kozu. The bottom left has a silo you can reach easily for 500,000 goo. 


## What's Next?
Ok, now you have your first outpost! Each outpost grants you 2 million more max capacity for all resources, so you should now have 3 million storage capacity. It is empty now, but you can build up to 4 of each resource generator, and it will auto-bank (automatically go straight into your storage). 

#### Take over 5 more outposts and build kits
Attack and loot until you have enough to take over 5 more outposts. At this point you should have 6 outposts with a total capacity of at least 13 million. You can now start building kits on your outposts. When building a kit, it replaces all buildings already existing on the outpost. 

The easiest targets for resources are level 28 and level 32 Dreadnauts, followed by any Legionnaire.

#### Upgrade flinger for more base range
You should begin upgrading your flinger if you can afford it. Each level gives you more range to attack from your main yard. If you want to attack further, you need to take over outposts and build and upgrade the flinger on those outposts. Outposts have a max range of 4 hexes instead of 10, unlike your main yard

#### Unlock Inferno
- Once you reach Town Hall level 5, Moloch will start attacking you. After 5 attacks, you can start attacking him back. Moloch does not attack you anymore after this, not even in the inferno base. Once you reach the end of his Descent bases, you can start building an Inferno base.
- It is similar to your main yard, with a couple changes
  - Resources are a completely different set, but they do the same thing
  - The building levels are maxed out at lower levels.
  - There is only 1 worker
  - The monsters unlocked have very high stat values

## Tips and Tricks

### Relocating
- If you find you are surrounded by higher levels or you do not like your location or server, you can relocate by recycling your map room and rebuilding it. It is super cheap: 2,000 twigs and 2,000 pebbles and only takes 15 minutes to build. You will randomly be placed in a random server in a random location. 
- Generally, your server name is the name of the player at 0x0. You can go to the [leaderboard](https://www.bymrefitted.com/leaderboards) to see the servers in order in the dropdown menu. If someone takes over the spot at 0x0 it may take some time for the page to update to the new name. 
- World 1 - 4hahahas
  - Oldest world
  - Has the biggest players but also the most inactives
- World 2 - ADESANYA
- World 3 - Gladios
- World 4 - DarkKnight
  - Newest world, therefore usually newest players
- You can start out in any world if you have a good location.
- *Usually* servers 1 and 4 are better to start out on as new players, as there are (currently?) fewer wars than in the other 2. This doesn't mean there are not other players who feel like bullying you one day for no reason though. It is quite easy starting out in a new location once you get in the groove of things. 
  - Disclaimer: This is what I have personally heard. I do not have accounts in each world to verify these claims.
  - Disclaimer 2: I do not update this guide constantly. You can ask in the discord for current status

### Quests
- The quests to take down wild tribe town halls do not work. In the original game, there was a map room version 1 where it could be completed. In BYM Refitted, we all start out in map room version 2, so the quest cannot be completed as of the writing of this guide.

### Shiny
- Shiny quests do not actually give shiny. It will subtract one instead.
- Everyone is part of the D.A.V.E. club. Everyone gets 400 shiny on the 20th of every month. 
- There is no way to buy shiny.
- Mushrooms grow back every day. They have a chance to give either 3 or 8 shiny.

### Events
- As of the writing of this guide, there are 2 events
  1. Wild Monster Invasion 1
  2. Wild Monster Invasion 2
- Each have 30 waves, and rewards you a totem to display depending on how far you made it
  - Since it repeats, if you make it further in a later iteration of the event, the totem is updated rather than duplicated.
- There are bonus waves also if you feel like taking them on. 
- Each event will run on the 10th of every month, alternating which event each month.

### Wild Tribes
- The somewhat daily or weekly wild monster attacks on your base can be somewhat influenced by the 3 options at the end of the attack. Friends option makes it less often, and the taunt makes it more often.
  - There is no positive or negative for this as they cannot steal your resources yet. But the repairing may be annoying
- Wild tribes will heal up fully after 12 hours of no attacking/viewing. To reset them, you must *View* their base. Attacking will not reset the base, but will instead refresh the 12 hour timer. 
- Easy targets are level 28/32 Dreadnauts and any level Legionnaire
  - Legionnaire tribes defenses are all Level 1 no matter what level, and they do not have traps either. They can be taken down by a swarm of Octo-oozes.
- Abunakki tribes have the highest level defenses. Avoid them until you are stronger
  - They have Eyeras and Fangs in their bunkers, so make sure to lure out the Eyeras to suicide before the full attack. 
- Kozu tribes have heavy traps. They deal BIG damage to your bigger monsters (like your champion)

### Inferno
- Moloch starts attacking your bases (up to 5 times) once you reach Town Hall level 5
- If you close out the game, the attack is skipped and your base is not damaged. 
- At the lower levels of descent, Teratorns and a flying Fomor are good at taking the bases out. 
- You can also use a level 1 Drull and juice/respawn him to spam him
- Champions only take damage from the towers, not the heat from the environment, so you can juice a level 1 champion after every attack to instant hatch a fully healed one.

### Champions
- Drull is the best starter champion to get started taking over outposts. His base attack at level 1 is equal to 50 Pokies.
  - If you have a juicer, you can juice Drull at any level after attacks and hatch a new one at full HP at level 1. If you have not invested much into Drull yet, this is a quick way to reset him to full HP. This can be very useful in taking down most of Moloch's Descent Inferno bases
- Korath is unlocked at town hall 7, and he is the best for base defense
- Krallen is unlocked at town hall 6. He buffs the amount of loot you get
  - This is buffed such that if your max storage capacity is 50 million resources, He allows you to loot over the cap to around 70 million instead. He does not directly multiply your loot by 30% from attacks 
- Fomor is great at buffing for Main Yard attacks and good at aerial attacks later when it grows wings

### Attacking
- Build a catapult! Even at lower levels, you can repeatedly send 10,000 twigs/pebbles to knock down towers
- Flinging putty in the catapult buffs your monsters. Higher amounts of putty give more armor and more speed.
  - The wording for armor is misleading. 10,000 putty will give 20% speed and 20% damage mitigation. They still take 80% damage, it is not 80% damage blocked.
- Upgrade your flinger for a larger range around your main base, up to 10 hexes away. If you upgrade your flinger all the way, you may see a 12 hex radius, but that is not the real range.
- Your main yard has up to a 10 tile fling radius. If you want to attack further, you must use your outposts. You can build housings and flingers on your outposts. Outposts have a max range of 4 hexes.
- You can also move your main base location for 30 million of every resource onto an outpost you already own.

### Catapult
- The catapult can be buggy and fire prematurely.
- You can get around this by clicking and dragging
  - Click and drag from the selection box to where you want to fire
  - Or Click and drag from the selection box back up to the catapult box, the one you clicked on initially at the top left. This will make sure it does not fire, and will allow you to still click and drag to navigate map before clicking once to fire. 

### Defense
- In my opinion, The best monsters to put in a bunker are Eyeras and Daves with rockets
- Level 1 bunker I usually put 2 Daves, 1 Eyera
- Level 2 bunker I usually put 2 Daves, 2 Eyera
- Level 3 bunker I usually put 3 Daves, 1 Eyera
- Level 4 bunker I usually put 3 Daves, 3 Eyera
- If facing the event wild monster waves, you might want to replace these with Octo-oozes or a large number of other monsters, because at later waves, they are completely immune for 30 seconds. So having a large number of monsters to delay them will be ideal.

### Outposts
- Each outpost gives 2 million max storage capacity for each resource. 
- The hexes directly beside your main base cost half the normal amount to takeover. 
- There is a resource production buff for the lower altitude hexes. They usually show up as sand tiles. There is a tower range buff for hexes on the higher altitude hexes. These usually show up as green/mountain tiles.
- When building a kit, it replaces all buildings already existing on the outpost. 

### Misc.
- When you start your account, you have a 7 day protection bubble. This WILL be removed on attacking anything.
- Protection on outposts will only be removed if you perform an attack that uses any of the monsters on that outpost. 
- You may remember monsters regenerating HP rather than remaking them every time after an attack. This is a feature of Map Room Version 3. This is currently not implemented, but the devs are working on it. It will be announced when ready.
- The yard planner allows for better placement options of buildings and structures. As you may notice when moving buildings around, it is in incements of diagonals. There are no direct ups and downs, but you can get around that with the yard planner. Those positions that are normally not possible via manual placement may be buggy if you use the yard planner to put things in those positions.
