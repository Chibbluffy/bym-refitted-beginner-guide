## Getting Started
If you are wondering how to get up and running as fast as possible, you came to the right place.  

The first thing you want to do, as you are going through the tutorial, is buy workers. With the starting 1500 shiny, you can buy 2 workers. 3 Total workers is enough to get started, but you will want at least 4 ASAP. Wait until the 20th of the month and you can afford a 4th one. Everyone receives 400 shiny every month on the 20th. 
  
After you finish the tutorial, rush to upgrade your silos. You will need at least 1 million base max capacity storage to take over your first outpost. 

There are 2 super easy ways you can get enough resources for this. Either attack some level 28 or level 32 Dreadnauts, or complete some upgrade quests. If you do not have any low level Dreadnauts or Legionnaires around, consider [relocating](#relocating).
1. You will have a few pokeys in your housing from the tutorial. Originally, there would be another part of the tutorial that leads you to attack some wild monster tribes, but that is not implemented in BYM Refitted. Instead, you can use these pokeys to attack Dreadnauts for easy resources. 3-4 pokeys can take out the whole silo that sits outside the base in a few minutes. Just attacking it should net you a few thousand of each resource, and killing it completely will give well over 100,000 of each resource except goo, so you may want to save the killing for later after upgrading a silo or two.

2. Quests are pretty easy also. Upgrade one of each resource gatherer to maybe level 3. You will also get resources from upgrading your silo. 


You will want to upgrade the Town Hall to at least level 3, and 2 silos to at least level 6. A third silo can be upgraded but doesn't have to reach 6 to give you 1 million storage capacity. 

Once you have 1 million storage capacity, you are ready to takeover something. Level 25 Legionnaires are the easiest and cheapest to takeover. If you are lucky, there will be a level 25 Legionnaire directly beside your main yard. You can take that over for half the normal cost, so half a million of each resource. You can swarm them with Pokeys or Octo-oozes if you decided to unlock that already. Make sure to bring their yard status to at least 90% damaged to take it over. If you need resources, don't forget to attack Dreadnauts in the area for free. It may take a few tries to get enough goo. 


## What's Next?
Ok, now you have your first outpost! Each outpost grants you 2 million more max capacity for all resources, so you should now have 3 million storage capacity. 
It is empty now, but you can build up to 4 of each resource generator, and it will auto-bank (automatically go straight into your storage). 

Attack and loot until you have enough to take over 5 more outposts. At this point you should have 6 outposts with a total capacity of 13 million. You can now start building kits on your outposts. When building a kit, it replaces all buildings already existing on the outpost. 

The easiest targets are level 28 and level 32 Dreadnauts, followed by any Legionnaire.

## Tips and Tricks
### Relocating
- If you find you are surrounded by higher levels or you do not like your location or server, you can relocate by recycling your map room and rebuilding it. It is super cheap: 2,000 twigs and 2,000 pebbles and only takes 15 minutes to build. You will randomly be placed in a random server in a random location. 
- Your server name is the name of the player at 0x0
- Server Styx is the oldest
- Servers OP and LOL are generally more pvp if you like to war
- Server DarkKnight is still chill for now, but this may change

### Quests
- The quests to take down wild tribe town halls do not work. In the original game, there was a map room version 1 where it could be completed. In BYM Refitted, we all start out in map room version 2, so the quest cannot be completed

### Shiny
- Shiny quests do not actually give shiny. It will subtract one instead.
- Everyone is part of the D.A.V.E. club. Everyone gets 400 shiny on the 20th of every month. 
- There is no way to buy shiny.
- Mushrooms grow back every day. They have a chance to give either 3 or 8 shiny.

### Wild Tribes
- Wild tribes will heal up fully after 12 hours of 
- Easy targets are level 28/32 Dreadnauts and any level Legionnaire
- Legionnaire tribes defenses are all Level 1 no matter what level, and they do not have traps either. They can be taken down by a swarm of Octo-oozes.
- Abunakki tribes have the highest level defenses. Avoid them until you are stronger
- Kozu tribes have heavy traps. They deal BIG damage to your bigger monsters (like your champion)
- 

### Champions
- Drull is the best starter champion to get started taking over outposts
- Korath is unlocked at town hall 7, and he is the best for base defense
- Krallen is unlocked at town hall 6. He buffs the amount of loot you get

### Attacking
- Build a catapult! You can repeatedly send 10,000 twigs/pebbles to knock down towers
- Flinging putty in the catapult buffs your monsters. Lower amounts of putty give more armor. Higher ammounts of putty give more speed.
- Your main yard has up to a 10 tile fling radius. If you want to attack further, you must use your outposts. You can build housings and flingers on your outposts
- You can also move your main base location for 30 million of every resource onto an outpost you already own.

### Outposts
- Each outpost gives 2 million max storage capacity for each resource. 
- The hexes directly beside your main base cost half the normal amount to takeover. 
- There is a resource production buff for the lower altitude hexes. They usually show up as sand tiles. There is a tower range buff for hexes on the higher altitude hexes. These usually show up as green/mountain tiles.
- When building a kit, it replaces all buildings already existing on the outpost.
